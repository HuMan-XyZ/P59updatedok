<h1>About</h1>
<br><br><br><br> 
<section> <p>I love books! It may sound strange, but I really do. Ever since I was around the age of 7, I've read a lot of books.
        My mother even used to ask me questions about the book I was reading, because she thought I read
        too fast to understand anything. But I could always retell the story. I really love to drift away into the
        fantasyworld of a book. This is what I think is the best about reading but there are other advantages
        about reading., let me describe a few.
        To begin with it's very relaxing. You can sit down at a quiet place and just forget about the world
        around you for a while. Sometimes when I feel like I have a million things to do I take a
        break,with a good book. After just a little
        while of reading I've got my strength up to take care of everything. It's also a great way to calm down.</section>
